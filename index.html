			<p>The first time that i visited shoprite was a long time ago i was only 6 years when i entered shoprite(game store) i saw many items that were stacked up in shelfs i was amazed with the beauty of the store that i never wanted to leave, on that day we bought a lot of goods and we left that section of shoprite i thought that was the end of me seeing this amazing place but instead of going to the car we went another wary which i found out that we were heading to the main shoprite itself the room was well ventilated, conditioned and well lighted the room was cool like a freezer and the items were too much i lost count of how many they are and i wondered how these shelfs could carry so much weight.</p>
			<p> There were so many items like toy cars, fruits, snacks, games(PS4) and bicycles these are the few that i remember but there are lot more items one thing out of the things that i liked about shoprite is that they are organized into sections each section deals with a particular type of good there are many sections like the Bakery, the games, the cutlery, the refreshment and the cloths section after.</p> 
			<p>We paid for the goods bought and we carried on our journey and went to another room in shoprite this room was named studio 24 , we entered it for a photo shoot and left just when i realized that we were about to goe as we were walking out of the shoprite mall my Dad was discussing and exchanging with the receptionist of the huge machine later on after 15 seconds the man told us to enter the machine that revolves around.</p>
			<p>you can see almost the entire Enugu i was frighteened by the height of the machine but i was brave enough to enter after entering the door was locked and the machine started it started unexpectedly with speed that can make someone faint instantly it ewnt round 10 times and finallly came to a stop then we came out and headed for the car after an amazing journey</p>
